        <h3>
          I'm a designer with a unique background in psychology. I bridge the
          gap between business, people, and technology. Unlike an artist, I
          focus on studying and measuring the impact of design on various
          business models.
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of my secret skills is cleaning up any mess I come across. I excel
          in piecing together fragments and setting things in motion. I'm always
          curious and will never hesitate to ask 'why' to uncover the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, you can find me immersed in gaming and enjoying
          classic anime from the '90s.
