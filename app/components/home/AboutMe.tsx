            I'm a designer with a unique background in psychology. I bridge the
            gap between business, people, and technology. Unlike an artist, I
            focus on studying and measuring the impact of design on various
            business models.

              One of my secret skills is cleaning up any mess I come across. I
              excel in piecing together fragments and setting things in motion.
              I'm always curious and will never hesitate to ask 'why' to uncover
              the truth.

              In my free time, you can find me immersed in gaming and enjoying
              classic anime from the '90s.
