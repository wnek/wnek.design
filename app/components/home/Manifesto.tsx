          According to Harvard Business Review, 75% of startups unfortunately
          don't succeed. I know the frustration of working hard and not seeing
          results.
        </h2>

          Every new concept appears promising. It's easy to simply follow in the
          footsteps of competitors, trust your instincts, or optimistically hope
          for the best. However, our judgment is often clouded by subtle biases,
          leading to less than rational decision-making.

          Impactful design goes beyond just aesthetic appeal. It must directly
          contribute to business performance. My approach incorporates design,
          psychology, and technology, with a specific focus on driving product
          growth.
        </p>
        <p>To that end, I vow to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Focus on the most critical performance metrics.</li>
          <li>Identify and prioritize customer needs and expectations.</li>
          <li>Create user experiences that drive conversions and growth.</li>
          <li>Tell dad jokes on every occasion.</li>
        </ol>
